# Sandbox

This reposity is a sandbox/playground for some code along tutorial courses I have taken, doing some challenges, small functionality of a site, or my own small projects.

Future Improvements:

- This project will be updated regularly, because I'm constantly learning new stuff.
- Not much for the UI/UX design, functionality first, then maybe add some improvements on the UI/UX perspective.
